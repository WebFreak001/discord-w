# discord-w

discord-w is a vibe.d based discord client library implementing API version 6.

Currently the API is WIP and might change and a lot of things are still missing. Currently implemented is only the gateway (read only ETF, full JSON) and channels (except file uploads).

## Example

See [test/](test) in this repository.
